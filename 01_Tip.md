1. Introduction

<Chat GPT>
Hello, GPT
I'm a scientific researcher. I'm writing a paper and the topic is "optimal interval between PTGBD and
cholecystectomy".
I would like to write a 3 paragraph introduction. The first paragraph will contain a brief introduction of the disease
entity in question. The second paragraph will contain the intervention, and its clinical relevance. The third
paragraph will address the research gap, considering the topic I have given you. Can you suggest a brief structure
for the introduction?



<Elicit>
Optimal interval between PTGBD and cholecystectomy

I am uploading a CSV file. Can you write down the contents of this file in the style of APA citation? Please number
the references.

I am a scientific researcher writing a research paper. The topic is "optimal interval between PTGBD and
cholecystectomy". Let's write the introduction section. I will provide some instructions in the following prompts.
Start writing only when I give you the command 'start now'.

Here is the structure of the introduction. Write a 3-paragraph introduction based on this structure.
(GPT가 써준 structure 복붙)

Here is the reference list for the introduction. Only use the references provided in this list.
(Elicit에서 받고 GPT가 text로 변환해준 ref list 복붙)

Here is an additional reference. This paper states that "early cholecystectomy is feasible after PTGBD, in low risk
patients". Integrate this content into the introduction, citing this paper.

<Claude>

Let's write the methods section.
I plan to perform a retrospective cohort study of patients who recieved cholecystectomy after PTGBD at Incheon St.
Mary's Hospital, from January 2018 to December 2023.
Here is the methods section of a similar study. Based on this content, write a methods section for our paper.

3. Results

<GPT>

This is a table describing the demographic data of a retrospective study comparing two groups.
Write the results section of this study, that explains this table.


==========================================

4. Discussion

<GPT>

I would like to write the discussion section.

In the first paragraph, I will summarize the findings of my study.
In the second paragraph, I will propose some possible mechanisms that may have caused these results.
In the following section, I will discuss some references that support my results
In the next section, I will discuss references that oppose my results.
In the next section, I will discuss the relevance of my study, in regard to the research gap existing in the current
literature.
In the last section, I will discuss the strengths and limitations of my study.
Lastly, I will state the conclusions.

Can you suggest a structure for the discussion?

<Claude>
Based on the references I have uploaded already, let's write the discussion section. I will give you instructions. Start
writing only when I give you the command 'start now'.

Here is the proposed structure. Do not use bullet points, or number the subheadings.

Provide a reference list that integrates the introduction section and the discussion section you've written. Number
the references in order of appearance in the text. Use the reference style of the journal 'Annals of Surgery'.
