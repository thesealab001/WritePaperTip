RespLLM: Unifying Audio and Text with Multimodal LLMs for Generalized Respiratory Health Prediction,"Yuwei Zhang, Tong Xia, Aaqib Saeed, Cecilia Mascolo","The high incidence and mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases underscores the importance of early screening. Machine learning models can automate clinical consultations and auscultation, offering vital support in this area. However, the data involved, spanning demographics, medical history, symptoms, and respiratory audio, are heterogeneous and complex. Existing approaches are insufficient and lack generalizability, as they typically rely on limited training data, basic fusion techniques, and task-specific models. In this paper, we propose RespLLM, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that unifies text and audio representations for respiratory health prediction. RespLLM leverages the extensive prior knowledge of pretrained LLMs and enables effective audio-text fusion through cross-modal attentions. Instruction tuning is employed to integrate diverse data from multiple sources, ensuring generalizability and versatility of the model. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that RespLLM outperforms leading baselines by an average of 4.6% on trained tasks, 7.9% on unseen datasets, and facilitates zero-shot predictions for new tasks. Our work lays the foundation for multimodal models that can perceive, listen to, and understand heterogeneous data, paving the way for scalable respiratory health diagnosis.","RespLLM, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that unifies text and audio representations for respiratory health prediction, outperforms leading baselines on trained tasks and unseen datasets, and facilitates zero-shot predictions for new tasks.","- RespLLM outperformed leading baselines by an average of 4.6% on trained tasks and 7.9% on unseen datasets.

Black Box Warning: Large Language Models and the Future of Infectious Diseases Consultation,"Ilan S Schwartz, Katherine E Link, Roxana Daneshjou, Nicolás W Cortés-Penfield","Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems trained by deep learning algorithms to process natural language and generate text responses to user prompts. Some approach physician performance on a range of medical challenges, leading some proponents to advocate for their potential use in clinical consultation and prompting some consternation about the future of cognitive specialties. However, LLMs currently have limitations that preclude safe clinical deployment in performing specialist consultations, including frequent confabulations, lack of contextual awareness crucial for nuanced diagnostic and treatment plans, inscrutable and unexplainable training data and methods, and propensity to recapitulate biases. Nonetheless, considering the rapid improvement in this technology, growing calls for clinical integration, and healthcare systems that chronically undervalue cognitive specialties, it is critical that infectious diseases clinicians engage with LLMs to enable informed advocacy for how they should—and shouldn’t—be used to augment specialist care.","Large language models (LLMs) have limitations that currently preclude their safe use in clinical consultations, but infectious diseases clinicians need to engage with LLMs to advocate for appropriate use of this technology.",Not mentioned (the abstract does not present any specific findings or results from a study)
Optimal consultations for those with respiratory illness,"N. Roberts, M. Partridge","Key points The spectrum of disease seen by health services has changed over time, but in many cases the mode of consultation has remained the same. Patients can be encouraged to attend either by making consultations more convenient or by using reminders. Preparation and follow-up are vital aspects of a successful consultation. Patients who are helped to understand their treatment may be more compliant. Educational aims To increase awareness of the need for specialist consultation clinics to be configured in a manner that is convenient for patients with long-term respiratory conditions. To encourage clinicians to consider the problems associated with non-attendance of patients in specialist clinics. To provide clinicians with the necessary knowledge to improve patient satisfaction with specialist outpatient consultations. Summary Consultations with those with respiratory disease increasingly involve those with longterm conditions. Such conditions merit greater attention being paid to the selection of simple treatment regimens, self-management education, enhancing compliance and good communication. The design and running of a respiratory consultation service can be enhanced by addressing the best use of the time before the consultation, the consultation itself and methods for reinforcing messages during follow-up.","The summary of the paper is that consultations for patients with respiratory diseases, especially long-term conditions, can be improved through better preparation, the consultation itself, and follow-up to enhance patient understanding and compliance.","- Improving convenience and using reminders can encourage patient attendance at consultations. - Preparation, follow-up, and helping patients understand their treatment are important for improving compliance. - The design and delivery of respiratory consultation services can be enhanced by optimizing the pre-consultation, consultation, and follow-up stages."
Evaluation of consultative skills in respiratory medicine using a structured medical consultation.,"D. Boudreau, R. Tamblyn, L. Dufresne","An essential component of competency in respiratory medicine is the acquisition of consultative skills. The American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) and other certification bodies have recommended a greater emphasis on the evaluation of clinical skills by direct observation. In this study, consultative abilities are assessed using the format of an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). A six-case, 160-min-long, examination was administered to three groups of physicians: faculty members, respiratory residents, and junior residents in internal medicine. The overall quality of the consultations was significantly better for the attending physicians when compared with the junior residents, and there was a systematic trend for the quality to improve with increased training. The educational value of the consultation improved significantly with the level of training. There was a tendency for physicians with greater experience to report less of the findings from the history and physical on their consultations. Patient satisfaction, as measured by the standardized patients using an ABIM patient satisfaction questionnaire, did not differ between groups of examinees. The test reliability for the overall quality of consultation score was 0.65. The reliability of a 14-station exam was estimated to be 0.81. This exam proved to be a useful, valid, and moderately reliable tool for assessing the consultative skills of physicians and could prove to be of benefit to clinical training programs.","The study evaluated the consultative skills of physicians in respiratory medicine using an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) format, and found that the quality and educational value of the consultations improved with increased physician training and experience.","- The overall quality and educational value of the consultations improved with increased level of training, with attending physicians performing better than junior residents.
- Physicians with greater experience tended to report fewer details from the history and physical examination in their consultations."
High consistency between recommendations by a pulmonary specialist and ChatGPT for the management of a patient with non-resolving pneumonia,"A. Chirino, T. Wiemken, S. Furmanek, William A. Mattingly, T. Chandler, Guillermo Cabral, R. Cavallazzi, R. Carrico, Julio A Ramirez","The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare is rapidly growing, with great potential to assist medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment of complex medical conditions. In this case report, the recommendations of a pulmonary consultation are compared to the recommendations from a large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, in regards to a case of non-resolving pneumonia. The recommendations by ChatGPT were found to be consistent with the pulmonary consultation, and no recommendations given were inappropriate. As shown in this case report, early generations of LLM such as ChatGPT were able to provide appropriate recommendations for the management of a patient with a complex medical condition.",The recommendations provided by the AI assistant ChatGPT for the management of a patient with non-resolving pneumonia were highly consistent with the recommendations made by a pulmonary specialist.,"- The recommendations from the pulmonary specialist and the AI platform (ChatGPT) were highly consistent in managing the patient with non-resolving pneumonia.

Specialist to non-specialist teleconsultations in chronic respiratory disease management: A systematic review,"Rutuja Patil, Rahul Shrivastava, Sanjay Kamlakar Juvekar, B. McKinstry, K. Fairhurst","Background Chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), are common public health problems with high prevalence, disability and mortality rates worldwide. Further uneven distribution of the health workforce is a major barrier to the effective diagnosis and treatment of CRDs. Teleconsultation between a specialist and non-specialist could possibly bridge the gap in access to health care and decrease CRD burden in remote areas. This review investigates the evidence for the effective use of specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation in the management of CRDs in remote areas and identifies instances of good practice and knowledge gaps. Methods We searched for articles till November 2020, which focused on specialist to non-specialist teleconsultations for CRD diagnosis or management. Two independent reviewers conducted the title and abstract screening and extracted data from the selected papers and the quality was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute’s (JBI) tool. A descriptive and narrative approach was used due to the heterogeneous nature of the selected studies. Results We found 1715, articles that met the initial search criteria, but after excluding duplicates and non-eligible articles, we included 10 research articles of moderate quality. These articles were from nine different studies, all of which, except one, were conducted in high-income countries. The studies reported results in terms of impact on the patients, and the health care providers including primary care physicians (PCP) and specialists. The teleconsulting systems used in all the selected papers primarily used audio modes in addition to other modes like the audio-video medium. The included studies reported primarily non-clinical outcomes including effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and usability of the teleconsultation systems and only three described the clinical outcomes. The teleconsultation was predominantly conducted in the PCP’s office with the specialist located remotely. Conclusions We found relatively few, papers which explored specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation in management of CRDs, and no controlled trials. Two of the included papers described systems, which were used for other diseases in addition to the CRD. The available literature although not generalisable, encourages the use of specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation for diagnosis and management of CRDs.",This systematic review investigated the evidence for the effective use of specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation in the management of chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) in remote areas and identified instances of good practice and knowledge gaps.,"- The review identified 10 relevant studies of moderate quality after screening a large number of initial articles.
- The majority of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, with only one exception.

Physician-ordered respiratory care vs physician-ordered use of a respiratory therapy consult service. Results of a prospective observational study.,"J. Stoller, C. Skibinski, D. Giles, E. L. Kester, D. Haney","OBJECTIVE

To assess the impact of a respiratory therapy consult service (RTCS) on practices and appropriateness of ordering respiratory care services.

DESIGN

Nonrandomized prospective observational cohort study with concurrent controls.

SETTING

Adult non-ICU inpatient wards of an academic medical center.

PATIENTS

A convenience sample of 98 adult non-ICU inpatients at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital, representing 20 inpatient clinical services. Patients whose respiratory care plans were determined by respiratory care practitioners using sign and symptom-based algorithms to specify treatment comprised the treatment group (n = 51, respiratory therapy consult group). The nonconsult group (n = 47) were patients whose respiratory care plans were specified by their own physicians.

INTERVENTION

Specification of the respiratory care plan by the RTCS vs by the physicians themselves. Use of the RTCS was at the discretion of the managing physician.

OUTCOME MEASURES

Types and number of respiratory care treatments, length of hospital stay, costs of the respiratory therapy provided, appropriateness of respiratory care orders (based on comparison of the actual respiratory care orders with a reference respiratory care plan generated by a study investigator who was kept blind to the actual respiratory care plan), and adverse respiratory events.

RESULTS

Patients for whom the RTCS was requested by their physicians had a greater severity of respiratory illness based on having a lower triage score, but were otherwise similar at baseline. Fewer initial orders for respiratory care were discordant with the reference algorithms in RTCS patients (15% +/- 26% [SD]) than in nonconsult patients (43% +/- 36%; p < 0.001), and a smaller fraction of RTCS patients received at least one discordant initial respiratory care order (37% vs 72%; p < 0.001). Though provided to sicker patients with longer lengths of hospital stay, RTCS-directed care incurred similar respiratory care costs per patient ($335.63 +/- $272.69 [RTCS] vs $349.06 +/- $273.27; p = 0.72).

CONCLUSIONS

These results suggest that the RTCS can be an effective strategy to allocate respiratory care strategies appropriately while conserving the costs of providing respiratory care.

The role of tele-medicine in patients with respiratory diseases,"N. Ambrosino, C. Fracchia"," Introduction: Tele-medicine is a clinical application connecting a patient with specialized care consultants by means of electronic platforms, potentially able to improve patients’ self-management and allow for the care of patients with limited access to health services. This article summarizes the use of tele-medicine as a tool in managing patients suffering from some pathological respiratory conditions. Areas covered: We searched papers published between 1990 and 2017 dealing with tele-medicine and respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, chronic respiratory failure, neuromuscular diseases, critical illness, home mechanical ventilation, and also legal and economic issues. Controlled trials report different results on feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and safety of tele-medicine. Expert commentary: Progress in tele-medicine widens the horizons in respiratory medicine: this tool may potentially reduce health care costs by moving some medical interventions from centralized locations in to patient’s home, also allowing for the delivery of care in countries with limited access to it. Legal, safety, and privacy problems, as well as reimbursement issues, must still be defined and solved. At present time, we still need much more evidence to consider this modality as a real option in the management of these patients.","This paper reviews the use of telemedicine as a tool for managing patients with various respiratory diseases, including the potential benefits, challenges, and the need for more evidence to consider telemedicine as a real option in the management of these patients.","- Controlled trials have reported mixed results on the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and safety of telemedicine in managing respiratory diseases.
- Telemedicine has the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve access to care, especially in areas with limited healthcare resources.
- However, there are still unresolved legal, safety, privacy, and reimbursement issues that need to be addressed before telemedicine can be considered a real option for managing patients with respiratory diseases."
Cost-Effectiveness of a New Outpatient Pulmonology Care Model Based on Physician-to-Physician Electronic Consultation,"J. Álvarez-Dobaño, M. Toubes, J. Novo-Platas, F. Reyes-Santías, G. Atienza, Manuel Portela, C. Rábade, T. Lourido, A. Casal, Carlota Rodríguez-García, V. Riveiro, R. Abelleira, J. Ricoy, N. Rodríguez-Núñez, C. Zamarrón, Felipe Calle, F. Gudé, L. Valdés","Introduction This study assesses the impact of an electronic physician-to-physician consultation program on the waiting list and the costs of a Pulmonology Unit. Materials and Methods A prepost intervention study was conducted after a new ambulatory pulmonary care protocol was implemented and the capacity of the unit was adopted. In the new model, physicians at all levels of healthcare send electronic consultations to specialists. Results In the preintervention year (2019), the Unit of Pulmonology attended 7,055 consultations (466 e-consultations and 6,589 first face-to-face visits), which decreased to 6,157 (3,934 e-consultations and 2,223 first face-to-face visits; 12.7% reduction) in the postintervention year (all were e-consultations). The mean wait time for the first appointment was 25.7 days in 2019 versus 3.2 days in 2021 (p < 0.001). In total, 43.5% of cases were solved via physician-to-physiciane-consultation. A total of 2,223 patients needed a face-to-face visit, with a mean wait time of 7.5 days. The mean of patients in the waiting listing decreased from 450.8 in 2019 to 44.8 in 2021 (90% reduction). The annual time devoted to e-consultations and first face-to-face visits following an e-consultation diminished significantly after the intervention (1,724 hours versus 2,312.8; 25.4% reduction). Each query solved via e-consultation represented a saving of €652.8, resulting in a total annual saving of €827,062. Conclusions Physician-to-physiciane-consultations reduce waiting times, improve access of complex patients to specialty care, and ensure that cases are managed at the appropriate level. E-consultation reduces costs, which benefits both, society and the healthcare system.","The implementation of an electronic physician-to-physician consultation program in a Pulmonology Unit reduced waiting times, improved access to specialty care, and resulted in significant cost savings for the healthcare system.","- The implementation of the electronic physician-to-physician consultation program led to a 12.7% reduction in the total number of consultations, with a shift from in-person visits to electronic consultations.

Improving Primary Care Access to Respirologists Using eConsult.,"Jean-Grégoire Leduc, E. Keely, C. Liddy, A. Afkham, Misha Marovac, S. Guglani","BACKGROUND
Patients and primary care providers (PCP) can experience frustration about poor access to specialist care. The Champlain Building Access to Specialists through eConsultation (BASETM) is a secure online platform that allows PCPs to ask a clinical question to 142 different specialty groups. The specialist is expected to respond within 7 days.
METHODS
This is a retrospective review of the Champlain BASETM respirology eConsults from January 2017 to December 2018. The eConsults were categorized by types of question asked by the referring provider, and by the clinical content of the referral. Specialists' response time and time spent answering the clinical question was analyzed. Referring providers close out surveys were reviewed to assess the impact of the respirology eConsult service on traditional referral rates and clinical course of action.
RESULTS
Of the 26,679 cases submitted to the Champlain BASE TM eConsult service 268 were respirology cases (1%). 91% were sent by family physicians, 9% by nurse practitioners. The median time to respond by specialists was 0.8 days, and the median time billed by specialists was 20 minutes. The most common topics were pulmonary nodules and masses (16.4%), cough (10.4%), infective problems (8.6%), COPD (8.6%) and dyspnea NYD (7.8%). The most common types of question asked by PCP were related to investigations warranted (43.1% of cases), general management (17.5%), monitoring (12.6%), need for a respirology referral (12.3%), and drug of choice (6.3%). In 23% of cases the PCP indicated they were planning to refer the patient and no longer need to (avoided referrals) and in 13% of cases the PCP was not going to refer but did after receiving the eConsult advice (prompted referrals). The eConsult led to a new or additional clinical course of action by the PCP in 49% of cases. In 51% of cases the PCP suggested the clinical topic would be well suited to a CME event.
CONCLUSIONS
Participation in eConsult services can improve timely access to respirologists while potentially avoiding clinic visit and significantly impacting referring PCPs clinical course of action. Using the most common clinical topics and types of question for CME planning should be considered. Future research may include a cost analysis, and provider perspectives on the role of eConsult in respirology care.",The Champlain BASETM eConsult service can improve access to respirologists and impact the clinical course of action for primary care provider patients.,"- 1% of the 26,679 cases submitted to the Champlain BASE eConsult service were respirology-related, with 91% sent by family physicians and 9% by nurse practitioners.
- The median time for specialists to respond to eConsults was 0.8 days, and the median time spent by specialists on each case was 20 minutes.
- The eConsult service helped avoid unnecessary referrals in 23% of cases, prompted referrals in 13% of cases, and led to a new or additional clinical course of action in 49% of cases."
